    <h1>Module 6: Transmission &amp; Security</h1>
    <p>
      In the final module, students investigate how data moves between the drone and its
      controller, and how to protect that communication from common threats.

    <!-- Week 27 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 27 – Cybersecurity Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>
        Students are introduced to core security ideas like confidentiality, integrity, and
        availability, and connect them to drone systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn the CIA triad and basic security terminology.</li>
        <li>Identify where data is stored and transmitted in their drone system.</li>
        <li>Discuss what it means to “secure” a drone in practice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mini-lecture on key cybersecurity concepts.</li>
        <li>Group brainstorm of ways a drone system could be attacked.</li>
        <li>Map CIA concepts to different parts of their own build.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Drones are networked computers with motors attached. Security thinking is essential to
        prevent misuse and protect people and data.
      </p>

    <!-- Week 28 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 28 – Wireless Threats</h2>
      <p>
        Students explore common wireless threats like interception, jamming, and spoofing, and
        consider how these could affect a drone in the real world.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize common wireless attack types.</li>
        <li>Connect each threat to potential drone failures or misuse cases.</li>
        <li>Begin thinking about defenses and mitigations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss case studies of wireless attacks in the news (age-appropriate).</li>
        <li>Identify which parts of the drone communication stack are exposed.</li>
        <li>Brainstorm practical classroom-safe demonstrations of interference.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding wireless risks makes the idea of “secure control links” concrete,
        not just a checkbox.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 29 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 29 – Threat Modeling</h2>
      <p>
        Students create a threat model for their own drone system, identifying assets, possible
        attackers, and realistic attack paths.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify what needs protection (devices, data, people).</li>
        <li>List potential attackers and their capabilities.</li>
        <li>Draw attack paths that show how an incident could happen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fill out a structured threat-modeling worksheet for their drone.</li>
        <li>Diagram data flows between controller, drone, and any external systems.</li>
        <li>Share and compare threat models in small groups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Threat modeling is a systematic way to think about risk. Students practice structured
        reasoning instead of just listing random “bad things.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 30 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 30 – Implementing Countermeasures</h2>
      <p>
        Based on their threat models, students choose and apply specific countermeasures to
        harden their drone’s communication and operation.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Connect threats to specific, realistic mitigations.</li>
        <li>Implement at least one technical or procedural control.</li>
        <li>Evaluate how well the chosen countermeasures address the risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose mitigations such as stronger pairing procedures, access control, or safe-flight rules.</li>
        <li>Implement configuration changes or simple code-level protections where appropriate.</li>
        <li>Test and document how the changes affect usage and security.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Security is only real when it changes behavior or technology. Students learn that even
        small mitigations can significantly reduce risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 31 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 31 – Demonstration &amp; Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        In the final week, students present their drones and explain not just how they fly,
        but how they addressed security and safety in their designs.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Showcase the completed drone and its capabilities.</li>
        <li>Communicate design and security decisions clearly.</li>
        <li>Reflect on what worked, what failed, and what they’d change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Run final demonstration flights or bench demos as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Have each group present their threat model and mitigations.</li>
        <li>Facilitate a class discussion about lessons learned and next steps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        The demo week ties the entire course together, celebrating student work and reinforcing
        both engineering and cybersecurity mindsets.
