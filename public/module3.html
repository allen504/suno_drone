    <h1>Module 3: Electronics &amp; Wiring</h1>
    <p>
      This module builds the electrical foundation students need before they touch the drone’s
      real hardware. Using breadboards, power sources, and measuring tools, students learn how
      circuits behave in the real world.
    </p>
    <p class="module-weeks">
      <strong>Main curriculum weeks:</strong> 3 (Introduction &amp; DC Circuits),
      4 (Ohm’s Law &amp; Measurement), 5 (Series &amp; Parallel Circuits),
      6 (Power Sources &amp; Batteries), 7 (Voltage Drop &amp; Real-World Effects)
    </p>

    <!-- Week 3 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 3 – Introduction &amp; DC Circuit Slides</h2>
      <p>
        Students are introduced to basic circuit concepts like voltage, current, and resistance,
        and see how these ideas show up in everyday electronics.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Orient students to the course and lab expectations.</li>
        <li>Understand what voltage, current, and resistance mean.</li>
        <li>Recognize simple DC circuit symbols and diagrams.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Slide-based introduction to DC circuits with real-life examples.</li>
        <li>Discuss batteries, LEDs, and other familiar components.</li>
        <li>Short prediction questions about what will happen in simple circuits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        These concepts are the vocabulary of electronics. Students will revisit them repeatedly
        while wiring and debugging the drone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 4 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 4 – Ohm’s Law &amp; Measurement</h2>
      <p>
        Students learn Ohm’s Law and practice using a multimeter to measure voltage, current,
        and resistance in a real circuit.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand and apply Ohm’s Law (V = I × R).</li>
        <li>Use a multimeter safely and correctly.</li>
        <li>Compare predicted values with actual measurements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Build simple resistor circuits on a breadboard.</li>
        <li>Measure voltage across and current through components.</li>
        <li>Practice swapping resistor values to see the effect on current.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Being able to measure and verify what a circuit is doing is essential for diagnosing
        issues later in the drone build.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 5 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 5 – Series &amp; Parallel Circuits</h2>
      <p>
        Students discover how combining resistors in series and parallel changes total resistance
        and how voltage and current distribute across a circuit.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Differentiate between series and parallel connections.</li>
        <li>Predict total resistance for both types of networks.</li>
        <li>Relate circuit configuration to brightness or behavior of loads.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Build both series and parallel LED/resistor circuits.</li>
        <li>Measure currents and voltages in each configuration.</li>
        <li>Compare observations to theoretical calculations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Real drones contain lots of series and parallel paths. Understanding how they behave
        prevents wiring mistakes that could damage components.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 6 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 6 – Power Sources &amp; Batteries</h2>
      <p>
        Students look more closely at batteries and power supplies, learning about capacity,
        internal resistance, and why power management matters.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand basic battery specs (voltage, capacity, C-rating).</li>
        <li>Discuss internal resistance and how it affects performance.</li>
        <li>Connect batteries safely in simple test circuits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Examine labels and datasheets for different batteries.</li>
        <li>Compare how different sources behave under load.</li>
        <li>Discuss LiPo safety and classroom handling rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        The drone depends on safe, reliable power. Misunderstanding batteries can lead to
        brownouts, crashes, or safety hazards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 7 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 7 – Voltage Drop &amp; Real-World Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Students see how wires, connections, and real components introduce voltage drops and
        losses that don’t show up in idealized diagrams.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Observe voltage drops along wires and across components.</li>
        <li>Recognize why long or thin wires can cause problems.</li>
        <li>Connect theory to the messy reality of physical circuits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Build circuits that intentionally show noticeable voltage drop.</li>
        <li>Measure voltages at multiple points and compare to expectations.</li>
        <li>Discuss how these issues could affect a drone in flight.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding real-world losses prepares students to route wires intelligently and
        diagnose subtle power problems in their drone.
