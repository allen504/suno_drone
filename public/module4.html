    <h1>Module 4: Arduino &amp; Control Code</h1>
    <p>
      In this module, students bring the drone to life with embedded code. They set up the
      programming environment, read sensor data, drive motors, and perform controlled tests
      before attempting a full flight.
    </p>
    <p class="module-weeks">
      <strong>Main curriculum weeks:</strong> 21 (FPV Camera),
      22 (Programming Setup &amp; Initial Code), 23 (Sensor Calibration),
      24 (Motor Testing), 25 (Bench Flight &amp; Safety Check)
    </p>

    <!-- Week 21 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 21 – FPV Camera</h2>
      <p>
        Students install and wire an FPV (First-Person View) camera system, learning how video
        integrates with the control system for piloting.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the basic components of an FPV system.</li>
        <li>Wire power and signal for the FPV camera and transmitter.</li>
        <li>Mount the camera securely on the drone frame.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Inspect an FPV camera and video transmitter (VTX) setup.</li>
        <li>Wire the system to the drone’s power distribution safely.</li>
        <li>Test the video feed and discuss latency and signal quality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        FPV is a common way to fly drones. Understanding how video and control systems interact
        prepares students for real-world piloting and troubleshooting.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 22 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 22 – Programming Setup &amp; Initial Code</h2>
      <p>
        Students set up their Arduino programming environment and load starter firmware that
        reads sensors and prepares to drive motors.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Install and configure the Arduino toolchain.</li>
        <li>Connect the board (e.g. via FTDI) and upload sample code.</li>
        <li>Understand the structure of the flight-control firmware.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Walk through installing the IDE or code editor.</li>
        <li>Upload a simple “blink” or serial-print program to verify the connection.</li>
        <li>Load the base flight-control sketch and identify key sections of code.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        This week establishes the software pipeline. If students can reliably program the board,
        every later code change becomes much more manageable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 23 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 23 – Sensor Calibration</h2>
      <p>
        Students calibrate the IMU (e.g., MPU6050) and verify that gyro and accelerometer
        readings are stable and meaningful.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand why sensors require calibration.</li>
        <li>Calibrate offsets and scaling for the IMU.</li>
        <li>Check sensor readings for noise and drift.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Run calibration routines from the flight firmware or helper sketches.</li>
        <li>Visualize sensor data over time (serial monitor, plots, etc.).</li>
        <li>Record calibration values and update configuration constants as needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        A drone can’t stabilize itself without trustworthy sensor data. Calibration connects
        abstract math to precise, real-world performance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 24 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 24 – Motor Testing</h2>
      <p>
        With drivers wired and sensors calibrated, students carefully test motor spinning,
        direction, and responsiveness under code control.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Verify that each motor spins when commanded.</li>
        <li>Check that motor directions match the intended configuration.</li>
        <li>Observe how code changes affect motor behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Run test routines that spin motors one at a time.</li>
        <li>Swap leads or update code to fix reversed motors.</li>
        <li>Discuss throttle curves, minimum spin thresholds, and safety precautions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Motor tests catch issues before the drone ever leaves the ground, preventing crashes
        due to swapped wires or buggy code.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 25 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 25 – Bench Flight &amp; Safety Check</h2>
      <p>
        Students perform “bench flight” tests, tethering or restraining the drone while running
        full control code to verify stability and safety.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Run the full control loop with the drone safely restrained.</li>
        <li>Check for abnormal vibrations, oscillations, or runaway behavior.</li>
        <li>Confirm that emergency stop procedures work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure the drone to a test rig or bench.</li>
        <li>Arm and throttle up slowly while monitoring behavior.</li>
        <li>Practice disarming quickly in response to unsafe conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Bench testing teaches structured, safety-first debugging before taking the risk of
        actual free flight.
