    <h1>Module 2: Fabrication &amp; 3D Printing</h1>
    <p>
      This module focuses on turning the drone frame from a digital model into a physical,
      flight-ready part. Students move from slicing to printing, post-processing, and
      preparing the frame for motors and electronics.
    </p>
    <p class="module-weeks">
      <strong>Main curriculum weeks:</strong> 12 (CAD + Slicing), 13 (3D Printing),
      14 (Post-Processing &amp; Assembly Prep), 15 (Review of Drone Electrical Architecture),
      16 (Motor Driver Circuit)
    </p>

    <!-- Week 12 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 12 – CAD + Slicing</h2>
      <p>
        Students finalize their 3D drone frame models and learn how to slice them for printing,
        choosing settings that balance strength, print time, and material use.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Finalize a clean, printable 3D frame model.</li>
        <li>Export the design as an STL (or similar) file.</li>
        <li>Understand slicer basics: layer height, infill, supports, and print time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean up CAD models (fix thin walls, remove floating geometry).</li>
        <li>Export STL files and load them into a slicer.</li>
        <li>Experiment with slicer settings and compare estimated print times and material usage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Students see how design decisions and slicer settings affect printability and durability,
        reinforcing the link between virtual design and real-world fabrication.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 13 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 13 – 3D Printing</h2>
      <p>
        With sliced models ready, students learn how to operate a 3D printer safely and supervise
        the printing of their drone frames or frame sections.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Safely operate a classroom 3D printer.</li>
        <li>Monitor an active print and recognize common failures.</li>
        <li>Compare the printed frame to the original model and expectations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Review 3D printer safety (hot end, moving parts, ventilation, supervision).</li>
        <li>Start prints for student frames and take turns monitoring progress.</li>
        <li>Identify and discuss issues like warping, bed adhesion problems, and stringing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Students gain hands-on fabrication skills and learn to troubleshoot physical problems
        that software alone cannot solve.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 14 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 14 – Post-Processing &amp; Assembly Prep</h2>
      <p>
        Students clean and refine their printed frames, making sure everything fits and the frame
        is robust enough for motors, props, and electronics.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn basic post-processing techniques for 3D printed parts.</li>
        <li>Prepare precise mounting points for motors and hardware.</li>
        <li>Verify that the frame is ready to accept electronics in later modules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove supports, trim artifacts, and lightly sand or file rough edges.</li>
        <li>Drill or ream mounting holes to match motor and standoff hardware.</li>
        <li>Test-fit motors, battery, and control boards so students can spot issues early.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        A printed frame is not automatically ready for flight. Post-processing teaches students
        how to turn a rough print into a functional, reliable part.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 15 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 15 – Review of Drone Electrical Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Students zoom out and look at the full electrical system of the drone: power, motors,
        sensors, radio, and control board, and how they all connect.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Map out all of the drone&#39;s electrical subsystems.</li>
        <li>Understand how power flows from the battery to every major component.</li>
        <li>Relate frame design decisions to where and how components will mount.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Draw a system-level diagram of the drone&#39;s wiring and components.</li>
        <li>Discuss where each component will be physically mounted on the printed frame.</li>
        <li>Identify potential cable routing and strain-relief strategies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Fabrication is not just printing a frame; it’s creating a structure that can cleanly host
        the entire electrical system without tangles or surprises later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Week 16 -->
    <section class="week-block">
      <h2>Week 16 – Motor Driver Circuit</h2>
      <p>
        Students build or assemble the motor driver stage that lets a low-power Arduino pin
        safely control high-current drone motors.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand why motor drivers are needed between the microcontroller and motors.</li>
        <li>Wire or solder the motor driver circuit correctly.</li>
        <li>Relate current, voltage, and power to real hardware limits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Class Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Review example motor driver circuits and datasheets.</li>
        <li>Assemble and wire the motor driver on perfboard or a small PCB.</li>
        <li>Check for shorts, correct polarity, and neat, serviceable wiring.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        This week bridges fabrication and electronics. Students see how structural and electrical
        decisions work together to produce a safe, controllable drone.
